# Custom_NN
## Introduction
Majority of times during experiments, one would like to compute results given a custom number of neurons, custom number of layers with custom activation functions. This notebook gives code to how to do it.
## Experiments
Two models with custom number of neurons, number of layers and activation functions were trained using this script. One was trained on California Housing Price dataset (Regression) and other on Wine dataset (Classification)
## Results
Models achieved 0.54 test loss on Regression task and 97.22% accuracy on Classification task.
